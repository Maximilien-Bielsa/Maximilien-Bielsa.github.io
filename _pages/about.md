I am a PhD Student in the Department of Economics at the University of Delaware. 

My current papers work with Assisted Reproductive Technology and child adoption relating to Same-Sex Marriage Legalization, and a resume audit study on the impact of pronouns on resumes.

My research interests include Labor Economics, Health Economics, and Experimental Economics with a particular focus on LGBT+ Individuals and households.
